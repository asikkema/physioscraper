# Physiomatch Job Scraper

A web scraper that monitors job listings from [physioswiss.ch](https://physioswiss.ch/stelleninserate/), tracks them in a SQLite database, and notifies you of new job postings and employers.

## What It Does

This script automatically:
- Scrapes all job listings from the physioswiss.ch job board
- Extracts key information: job number, posting date, employer name, job title, and URL
- Stores data in a local SQLite database
- **Detects new job postings** that weren't in the database before
- **Identifies new employers** appearing for the first time
- Shows you a summary report after each run

**Important:** Run this script regularly (e.g., daily or weekly) to stay updated on new job opportunities and track which employers are newly posting positions.

4. Click "Install Now"
5. Verify installation by opening Command Prompt (search "cmd" in Start menu) and typing:
   ```cmd
   python --version
   ```
   You should see something like `Python 3.11.x`

## Database

All job data is stored in `jobs.db` (SQLite database) in the project folder. This file:
- Keeps track of all jobs you've seen
- Enables detection of new postings
- Persists between runs

**Don't delete this file** unless you want to reset and re-discover all jobs as "new".

## Recommended Usage

Run the scraper regularly to monitor for new opportunities:
- **Daily:** For active job hunting
- **Weekly:** For passive monitoring
- **Whenever needed:** To check for updates

Each run only reports jobs and employers that are truly new since the last run.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+
- Playwright (web automation)
- SQLite (database)
- uv (package manager)

## Troubleshooting

**"python is not recognized"**: Python wasn't added to PATH during installation. Reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH".

**"uv: command not found"**: Run `pip install uv` again.

**Browser doesn't open**: Run `uv run playwright install chromium` to install the browser.

**Permission errors on Windows**: Run Command Prompt as Administrator (right-click ‚Üí "Run as administrator").
